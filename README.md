# ComfyUI Notifications

This package provides custom nodes to ComfyUI to notify users when workflows have completed.

These tools are also available via [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/royceschultz/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts), but this package comes without the bloat of other tools.

## Send Notification

Sends a system notification via the browser.

## Play Sound

Plays a chime sound to notify the user.
